                    computing, thanks to client-side code that runs within web browsers. The usual
                    tension between security and functionality is particularly acute in a
                    mobile-code setting, and current platforms disappoint on both dimensions.
                    
                    We introduce a new architecture for secure mobile code, with which developers
                    can use, publish, and share mobile code securely across trust domains. This
                    architecture enables new kinds of distributed applications, and makes it easier
                    to reuse and evolve code from untrusted providers. The architecture gives
                    mobile code considerable expressive power: it can securely access distributed,
                    persistent, shared information from multiple trust domains, unlike web
                    applications bound by the same-origin policy. The core of our approach is
                    analyzing how ﬂows of information within mobile code affect conﬁdentiality and
                    integrity. Because mobile code is untrusted, this analysis requires novel
                    constraints on information ﬂow and authority.
                    
                    We show that these constraints offer principled enforcement of strong security
                    while avoiding the limitations of current mobile-code security mechanisms. We
                    evaluate our approach by demonstrating a variety of mobilecode applications,
                    showing that new functionality can be offered along with strong security.}

                lives. Applications that make many small accesses to the database create two
                challenges for developers: increased latency and wasted resources from numerous
                network round trips. A well-known technique to improve transactional database
                application performance is to convert part of the application into stored
                procedures that are executed on the database server. Unfortunately, this
                conversion is often difﬁcult. In this paper we describe Pyxis, a system that
                takes database-backed applications and automatically partitions their code into
                two pieces, one of which is executed on the application server and the other on
                the database server. Pyxis proﬁles the application and server loads, statically
                analyzes the code’s dependencies, and produces a partitioning that minimizes
                the number of control transfers as well as the amount of data sent during each
                transfer. Our experiments using TPC-C and TPC-W show that Pyxis is able to
                generate partitions with up to 3× reduction in latency and 1.7× improvement in
                throughput when compared to a traditional non-partitioned implementation and
                has comparable performance to that of a custom stored procedure

	abstract={Because information flow control mechanisms often rely on an
              underlying authorization mechanism, their security guarantees can be subverted
              by weaknesses in authorization. Conversely, the security of authorization can
              be subverted by information flows that leak information or that influence how
              authority is delegated between principals. We argue that interactions between
              information flow and authorization create security vulnerabilities that have
              not been fully identified or addressed in prior work. We explore how the
              security of decentralized information flow control (DIFC) is affected by three
              aspects of its underlying authorization mechanism: first, delegation of
              authority between principals, second, revocation of previously delegated
              authority, third, information flows created by the authorization mechanisms
              themselves. It is no surprise that revocation poses challenges, but we show
              that even delegation is problematic because it enables unauthorized
              downgrading. Our solution is a new security model, the Flow-Limited
              Authorization Model (FLAM), which offers a new, integrated approach to
              authorization and information flow control. FLAM ensures robust authorization,
              a novel security condition for authorization queries that ensures attackers
              cannot influence authorization decisions or learn confidential trust
              relationships. We discuss our prototype implementation and its algorithm for

	abstract={Real-world applications routinely make authorization decisions
              based on dynamic computation. Reasoning about dynamically computed authority is
              challenging. Integrity of the system might be compromised if attackers can
              improperly influence the authorizing computation. Confidentiality can also be
              compromised by authorization, since authorization decisions are often based on
              sensitive data such as membership lists and passwords. Previous formal models
              for authorization do not fully address the security implications of permitting
              trust relationships to change, which limits their ability to reason about
              authority that derives from dynamic computation. Our goal is a way to construct
              dynamic authorization mechanisms that do not violate confidentiality or
              integrity. We introduce the Flow-Limited Authorization Calculus (FLAC), which
              is both a simple, expressive model for reasoning about dynamic authorization
              and also an information flow control language for securely implementing various
              authorization mechanisms. FLAC combines the insights of two previous models: it
              extends the Dependency Core Calculus with features made possible by the
              Flow-Limited Authorization Model. FLAC provides strong end-to-end information
              security guarantees even for programs that incorporate and implement rich
              dynamic authorization mechanisms. These guarantees include noninterference and
              robust declassification, which prevent attackers from influencing information
              disclosures in unauthorized ways. We prove these security properties formally
              for all FLAC programs and explore the expressiveness of FLAC with several

                generalize optimistic concurrency control, improving throughput because clients
                holding warranties need not communicate to verify the warranty’s assertion.
                Updates that might cause an active warranty to become false are delayed until
                the warranty expires, trading write latency for read latency. For workloads
                biased toward reads, warranties improve scalability and system throughput.
                Warranties can be expressed using language-level computations, and they
                integrate harmoniously into the programming model as a form of memoization.
                Experiments with some nontrivial programs demonstrate that warranties enable

    abstract = {Distributed information systems are prevalent in modern
                computing but difﬁcult to build securely. Because systems commonly span domains
                of trust, host nodes share data and code of varying degrees of trustworthiness.
                Modern systems are often open and extensible, making security even harder to
                reason about. Unfortunately, standard methods for software construction do not
                help programmers enough with ensuring their software is secure.
                
                Fabric is a system and language for building open, distributed, extensible
                information systems that are secure by construction. Fabric is a decentralized
                system that allows nodes to securely share both data and code despite mutual
                distrust. All resources are labeled with conﬁdentiality and integrity policies
                that are enforced through a combination of compile-time and run-time
                mechanisms.
                
                The Fabric language offers a high-level but powerful model of computation. All
                resources appear as objects in the language, and the distribution and
                persistence of code and data are largely transparent to programmers. Fabric
                supports both data-shipping and query/RPC styles of computation: computation
                and information can both move between nodes. Optimistic, nested transactions
                ensure consistency across all objects and nodes. Fabric programs can securely
                share mobile code across trust domains, enabling more reuse and evolution of
                code and supporting new kinds of secure applications not possible in other
                distributed systems. Results from applications built using Fabric suggest that
                Fabric enforces strong security while offering a clean, concise, powerful
                programming model with good performance. An open-source prototype is available
                for download.}

              expressive and intuitive vehicles for describing allowed information flows.
              JRIF is a dialect of Java that uses RIF automata for specifying information
              flow control policies. The implementation of JRIF involved replacing the

                because it offers strong end-to-end guarantees, it is inherently compositional,
                and it can be enforced using a simple security type system. Unfortunately, it
                is too restrictive for real systems. Mechanisms for downgrading information are
                needed to capture real-world security requirements, but downgrading eliminates
                the strong compositional security guarantees of noninterference.
                
                We introduce nonmalleable information flow, a new formal security condition
                that generalizes noninterference to permit controlled downgrading of both
                confidentiality and integrity. While previous work on robust declassification
                prevents adversaries from exploiting the downgrading of confidentiality, our
                key insight is transparent endorsement, a mechanism for downgrading integrity
                while defending against adversarial exploitation. Robust declassification
                appeared to break the duality of confidentiality and integrity by making
                confidentiality depend on integrity, but transparent endorsement makes
                integrity depend on confidentiality, restoring this duality. We show how to
                extend a security-typed programming language with transparent endorsement and
                prove that this static type system enforces nonmalleable information flow, a
                new security property that subsumes robust declassification and transparent
                endorsement. Finally, we describe an implementation of this type system in the
                context of Flame, a flow-limited authorization plugin for the Glasgow Haskell
                Compiler.}

              policies will be enforced on untrusted hosts. Trusted execution environments
              (TEEs) combined with cryptographic mechanisms enable execution of known code on
              an untrusted host and the exchange of conﬁdential and authenticated messages
              with it. TEEs do not, however, establish the trustworthiness of code executing
              in a TEE. Thus, developing secure applications using TEEs requires specialized
              expertise and careful auditing.
              
              This paper presents DFLATE, a core security calculus for distributed
              applications with TEEs. DFLATE offers high-level abstractions that reﬂect both
              the guarantees and limitations of the underlying security mechanisms they are
              based on. The accuracy of these abstractions is exhibited by asymmetry between
              conﬁdentiality and integrity in our formal results: DFLATE enforces a strong
              form of noninterference for conﬁdentiality, but only a weak form for integrity.
              This reﬂects the asymmetry of the security guarantees of a TEE: a malicious
              host cannot access secrets in the TEE or modify its contents, but they can
              suppress or manipulate the sequence of its inputs and outputs. Therefore DFLATE
              cannot protect against the suppression of high-integrity messages, but when
              these messages are delivered, their contents cannot have been inﬂuenced by an
              attacker.}

                    other TEE frameworks support mutual authentication in some form, Decent is the
                    only system that supports mutual authentication without requiring an additional

                    and implemented two applications to evaluate Decent’s expressiveness and
                    performance: DecentRide, a ride-sharing service, and DecentHT, a distributed
                    hash table. On the YCSB benchmark, we show that DecentHT achieves 7.5x higher
                    throughput and 3.67x lower latency compared to a non-Decent implementation.}

              compromised by authorization, since authorization decisions are often based on
              sensitive data such as membership lists and passwords. Previous formal models
              for authorization do not fully address the security implications of permitting
              trust relationships to change, which limits their ability to reason about
              authority that derives from dynamic computation. Our goal is an approach to
              constructing dynamic authorization mechanisms that do not violate
              confidentiality or integrity.  The Flow-Limited Authorization Calculus (FLAC)
              is a simple, expressive model for reasoning about dynamic authorization as well
              as an information flow control language for securely implementing various
              authorization mechanisms. FLAC combines the insights of two previous models: it
              extends the Dependency Core Calculus with features made possible by the
              Flow-Limited Authorization Model. FLAC provides strong end-to-end information
              security guarantees even for programs that incorporate and implement rich
              dynamic authorization mechanisms. These guarantees include noninterference and
              robust declassification, which prevent attackers from influencing information
              disclosures in unauthorized ways. We prove these security properties formally
              for all FLAC programs and explore the expressiveness of FLAC with several
              examples.}
